# 🖥️ HomeLab Dashboard & Monitoring Fleet

A lightweight, real-time homelab monitoring suite designed specifically for resource-constrained microservers, low-power appliances (such as PC Engines APU2, Intel NUCs, Raspberry Pis), NAS systems, and workstations.

It combines an outbound **push-based telemetry model** with real-time **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**, eliminating complex network scraping and firewall configuration while delivering sub-second updates to a zero-build vanilla web UI.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🌐 Push-Based Telemetry**: Client nodes push telemetry outbound every 5 seconds. Seamlessly operates through NATs, firewalls, and VPN tunnels without requiring open inbound ports on monitored hosts.
- **⚡ Real-Time SSE Streaming**: Live updates stream directly into your browser over an efficient persistent HTTP Server-Sent Events connection.
- **🎨 Zero-Build Modern UI**: Built with vanilla ES6 JavaScript modules, HTML5 Canvas, and a token-driven CSS architecture. Zero `npm build`, Webpack, or framework bloat required.
- **🔒 Multi-Layer Security**:
  - Administrative access secured with **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** password hashing and 14-day bearer session tokens.
  - First-run setup overlay automatically initializes the master admin account and locks subsequent registration.
  - Ingestion secured via a unique, cryptographically generated `X-Agent-Key` header.
- **📊 30-Day SQLite History & Downsampling**: Lab-wide power consumption is logged every minute with automatic 30-day retention pruning. Features fast mathematical integer-bucketing downsampling (`6H`, `24H`, `7D`, `30D`).
- **🖥️ Deep Hardware Instrumentation**:
  - **CPU & RAM**: Marketing model retrieval, core count breakdown, and live utilization bars with real-time Canvas sparklines.
  - **Power Draw (Watts)**: Real-time CPU and GPU wattage tracking (via Linux RAPL / hwmon, Windows Performance Counters, or TDP load interpolation) with estimated monthly running electricity costs.
  - **Storage & I/O**: Multi-disk partition scanning with individual utilization meters and live read/write throughput speeds ($\text{MB/s}$).
  - **Network & Bandwidth**: Live download/upload transfer rates.
  - **NVIDIA GPU Monitoring**: Auto-detects NVIDIA cards with utilization, VRAM usage, temperature, and wattage.
  - **VPN & Docker**: Live state detection for Tailscale, OpenVPN, and running Docker containers.
- **🔄 Asynchronous OS Update Detection**: Runs in a non-blocking background thread once every 4 hours to check for pending packages on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) and Windows without stalling telemetry.
- **🔔 Alarm Chimes & Hysteresis**:
  - Synthesizes sci-fi alarm tones using the browser's native **Web Audio API** (zero external audio assets).
  - Dual-threshold **hysteresis** (e.g. triggers at 85%, clears at 75%) to eliminate notification flapping.
- **📌 Customization & Device Pinning**: Pin your most critical servers to the top of the grid with zero-overhead `localStorage` persistence.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start the Central Dashboard Server

On your central Linux or Windows server:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# 2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Start the server
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Open your browser at `http://<SERVER-IP>:8000`. On the first load, create your administrator account. Once logged in, click the **Key** badge in the top bar to copy your generated **Agent Key**.

---

### 2. Deploy Client Agents

On each server, NAS, or workstation you want to monitor:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to agent directory
cd agent

# 2. Create virtual environment & install dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Edit `agent.py` to set your dashboard server IP and master Agent Key:
```python
SERVER_URL = "http://<SERVER-IP>:8000/api/report"
AGENT_KEY = "<YOUR_COPIED_AGENT_KEY>"
```

Run the agent:
```bash
python agent.py
```
Within 5 seconds, the node will appear dynamically on your dashboard grid.

## 🛠️ Configuration & Tunables

- **Alert Thresholds & Electricity Rate**: Edit `frontend/js/config.js` to customize CPU/GPU trip points, recovery points, and local `$/kWh` electricity tariffs.
- **Monitored Services**: Edit `backend/services.json` to add or remove self-hosted web applications.
- **Hostname Icons**: Extend the heuristic table in `frontend/js/format.js` (`deviceIcon()`) to assign custom icons based on hostname regex patterns.
- **Theme & Colors**: Modify the CSS custom properties in `frontend/css/tokens.css` to retheme the entire dashboard.
